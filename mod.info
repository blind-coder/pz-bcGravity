description=Obey gravity. It's the law. <LINE> This mod lets structures come crashing down when their support structures are removed. All structures must have a wall in a 5x5 area below or get destroyed. Also prevents players from building floors more than 3 tiles away from any wall. <LINE> <LINE> Mod preview image by Onkeen. Thanks!
